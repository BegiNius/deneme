This project includes a basic service worker to cache core assets for faster repeat visits.

## Performance

- **HTTP Caching**: A service worker (`sw.js`) caches static assets.
- **Compression**: Enable Gzip or Brotli on your hosting or CDN to reduce payload size.
- **CDN**: Serve static assets via a CDN for better global performance.

## Development

Install dependencies and run a local server if needed.
